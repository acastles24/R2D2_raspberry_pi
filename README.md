# R2-D2 Raspberry Pi

Welcome to my R2-D2 robot! This robot uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Node.js and an MQTT server to receive commands from the associated iOS app.
The encoded Bluetooth commands are sent by the Sphero V2 API.

Current supported actions are manual roll in all directions with variable speed, turn dome and change stance (between tripod and bipod).
